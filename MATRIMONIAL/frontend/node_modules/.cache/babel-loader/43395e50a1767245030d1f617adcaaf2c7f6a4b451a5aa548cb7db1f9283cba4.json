We analyze over 100 compatibility factors to suggest potential matches that align with what you are looking for in a life partner. As you interact with profiles, our system learns your preferences better, improving match quality over time.'\n    }, {\n      id: 'g2',\n      question: 'Is my personal information secure on your platform?',\n      answer: 'Yes, we take your privacy very seriously.

We offer several premium tiers to suit different needs and budgets.'\n    }, {\n      id: 'm2',\n      question: 'How do I upgrade or cancel my membership?',\n      answer: 'You can upgrade your membership anytime through the \"Membership\" section in your account settings.

We recommend uploading 4-6 recent photos in different settings, completing all profile sections, being specific about your preferences and deal-breakers, and writing a thoughtful bio that highlights what makes you unique. Verified profiles receive 5x more interest, so completing verification is also highly recommended.'\n    }, {\n      id: 'p2',\n      question: 'Can I change my preferences after creating my profile?',\n      answer: 'Absolutely! You can update your preferences at any time.

Consider seasonal updates as well, as this shows you are actively engaged in your search.'\n    }, {\n      id: 'p4',\n      question: 'What photos are not allowed on profiles?',\n      answer: 'We prohibit photos that are overly revealing, contain children as the primary subject, include contact information, show excessive filters/editing, include multiple people where your identity is unclear, or contain watermarks from other matrimonial sites.

For safety, use our integrated calling feature first, which does not reveal your actual phone number. Premium members can request contact details through our secure verification system once both parties agree.'\n    }, {\n      id: 'c2',\n      question: 'What if someone is being inappropriate in their messages?',\n      answer: 'We have zero tolerance for inappropriate behavior.

Our moderation team reviews reports within 24 hours and takes appropriate action, including warnings, temporary suspensions, or permanent bans for serious violations.'\n    }, {\n      id: 'c3',\n      question: 'How long should I wait before meeting someone in person?',\n      answer: 'There is no fixed timeline, but we recommend communicating through our platform for at least 2-3 weeks before arranging an in-person meeting. Use this time to have video calls (available in our app for premium members) to build comfort and verify compatibility. When you do meet, follow our safety guidelines by choosing public locations and informing someone you trust about your plans.'\n    }, {\n      id: 'c4',\n      question: 'Are there any communication etiquette guidelines I should follow?',\n      answer: 'Yes, respectful communication is essential. Respond to messages within a reasonable timeframe (ideally 48 hours), ask thoughtful questions beyond what is in their profile, be honest about your intentions, respect boundaries if someone declines further communication, and avoid generic copy-pasted messages. Quality conversations focusing on compatibility factors lead to the best outcomes.'\n    }],\n    success: [{\n      id: 's1',\n      question: 'What is your success rate for matches?',\n      answer: 'Our platform has facilitated over 100,000 successful marriages over the past decade.

compatibility. We analyze over 100 compatibility factors to suggest potential matches that align with what you are looking for in a life partner. As you interact with profiles, our system learns your preferences better, improving match quality over time.'\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: 'g2',\r\n        question: 'Is my personal information secure on your platform?',\r\n        answer: 'Yes, we take your privacy very seriously.

You control who can view your full profile, and you can adjust your privacy settings at any time from your account dashboard.'\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: 'g3',\r\n        question: 'How long does the verification process take?',\r\n        answer: 'Our standard verification process typically takes 24-48 hours after you submit all required documents.

We recommend uploading 4-6 recent photos in different settings, completing all profile sections, being specific about your preferences and deal-breakers, and writing a thoughtful bio that highlights what makes you unique.

When you do meet, follow our safety guidelines by choosing public locations and informing someone you trust about your plans.'\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: 'c4',\r\n        question: 'Are there any communication etiquette guidelines I should follow?',\r\n        answer: 'Yes, respectful communication is essential. Respond to messages within a reasonable timeframe (ideally 48 hours), ask thoughtful questions beyond what is in their profile, be honest about your intentions, respect boundaries if someone declines further communication, and avoid generic copy-pasted messages. Quality conversations focusing on compatibility factors lead to the best outcomes.'\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    success: [\r\n      {\r\n        id: 's1',\r\n        question: 'What is your success rate for matches?',\r\n        answer: 'Our platform has facilitated over 100,000 successful marriages over the past decade.
